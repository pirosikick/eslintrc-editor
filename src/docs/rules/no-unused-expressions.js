Unused expressions are those expressions that evaluate to a value but are never used. For example:

\`\`\`js
"Hello world";
\`\`\`

This string is a valid JavaScript expression, but isn't actually used. Even though it's not a syntax error it is clearly a logic error and it has no effect on the code being executed.

## Rule Details

This rule aims to eliminate unused expressions. The value of an expression should always be used, except in the case of expressions that side effect: function calls, assignments, and the \`new\` operator.

The following patterns are considered warnings:

\`\`\`js
0
\`\`\`

\`\`\`js
if(0) 0
\`\`\`

\`\`\`js
{0}
\`\`\`

\`\`\`js
f(0), {}
\`\`\`

\`\`\`js
a && b()
\`\`\`

The following patterns are not considered warnings:

\`\`\`js
{}
\`\`\`

\`\`\`js
f()
\`\`\`

\`\`\`js
a = 0
\`\`\`

\`\`\`js
new C
\`\`\`

\`\`\`js
delete a.b
\`\`\`

\`\`\`js
void a
\`\`\`
`);
  }
});
